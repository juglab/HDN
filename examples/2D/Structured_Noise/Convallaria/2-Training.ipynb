    "# Training a Hierarchical DivNoising network for Convallaria data which is intrinsically noisy\n",
    "This notebook contains an example on how to train a Hierarchical DivNoising Ladder VAE for an intrinsically noisy data containing both pixel noise and structured noise. This requires having a noise model (model of the imaging noise) for pixel noises which can be either measured from calibration data or bootstrapped from raw noisy images themselves. If you haven't done so, please first run '1-CreateNoiseModel.ipynb', which will download the data and create a noise model. "

    "<code>model_name</code> specifies the name of the model with which the weights will be saved and wil be loaded later for prediction.<br>\n",

    "<code>max_epochs</code> specifies the total number of training epochs. Around $150-200$ epochs work well generally.<br>\n",

However, more stochastic layers may improve performance for some datasets at the cost of increased training time.<br>\n",

    "<code>use_uncond_mode_at</code> specified which layers from the network can be selectively deactivated (refer to the paper to understand the motivation). Usually, for structured noise removal, setting it to $[0,1]$ works well. This correponds to selectively deactivating the contributions from the bottom two layers in the hierarchy with the bottom-most layer denoted with $0$ and the second layer from bottom denoted as layer $1$. If no deactivation is desired, just set the parameter ```use_uncond_mode_at=[]```.\n",

    "**__Note:__** With these settings, training will take approximately $24$ hours on Tesla P100/Titan Xp GPU needing about 6 GB GPU memory. We optimized the code to run on less GPU memory. For faster training, consider increasing ```virtual_batch_size``` but since we have not tested with different settings of ```virtual_batch_size```, we do not yet know how this affects results. To reduce traing time, also consider reducing either ```num_latents``` or ```blocks_per_layer``` to $4$. These settings will bring down the training time to around $12-15$ hours while still giving good results."
